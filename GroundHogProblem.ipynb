    "On February 2<sup>nd</sup> every year Punxsutawney Phil makes a prediction about if there will be an early Spring or if Winter will continue for 6 more weeks (till about mid-March). He is however not very accurate (well, according to [The Inner Circle](https://www.groundhog.org/inner-circle) he is 100% correct but the human handler may not interpret his response correctly). The overall goal is to be able to predict if it will be an early Spring.\n",

    "For this project you must go through most steps in the checklist. You must write responses for all items however sometimes the item will simply be \"does not apply\". Some of the parts are a bit more nebulous and you simply show that you have done things in general (and the order doesn't really matter). Keep your progress and thoughts organized in this document and use formatting as appropriate (using markdown to add headers and sub-headers for each major part). Do not do the final part (launching the product) and your presentation will be done as information written in this document in a dedicated section, no slides or anything like that. It should however include the best summary plots/graphics/data points.\n",

    "You are intentionally given very little information thus far. You must communicate with your client (me) for additional information as necessary. But also make sure that your communications are efficient, thought out, and not redundant as your client might get frustrated and \"fire\" you (this only applies to getting information from your client, this does not necessary apply to asking for help with the actual project itself - you should continuously ask questions for getting help).\n",
